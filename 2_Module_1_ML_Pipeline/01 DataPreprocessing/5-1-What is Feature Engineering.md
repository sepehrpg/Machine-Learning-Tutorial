# What is Feature Engineering?
Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, creating or modifying features like input variables or data to help machine learning models learn patterns more effectively. It involves transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that improve model accuracy and performance.
This step may include handling missing values, encoding categories, scaling numbers, creating new features or combining existing ones. It helps turn messy real-world data into a form that models can understand and use for better predictions.

# Importance of Feature Engineering
- **Improve accuracy:** Choosing the right features helps the model learn better, leading to more accurate predictions.
- **Reduce overfitting:** Using fewer, more important features helps the model avoid memorizing the data and perform better on new data.
- **Boost interpretability:** Well-chosen features make it easier to understand how the model makes its predictions.
- **Enhance efficiency:** Focusing on key features speeds up the model’s training and prediction process, saving time and resources.

# Processes Involved in Feature Engineering
Lets see various features involved in feature engineering:
- Feature Creation
- Feature Transformation
- Feature Extraction
- Feature Selection
- Feature Scaling

## 1. Feature Creation
Feature creation involves generating new features from domain knowledge or by observing patterns in the data. It can be:
- **Domain-specific:** Created based on industry knowledge like business rules.
- **Data-driven:** Derived by recognizing patterns in data.
- **Synthetic:** Formed by combining existing features.

## 2. Feature Transformation
Transformation adjusts features to improve model learning:
- **Normalization & Scaling:** Adjust the range of features for consistency.
- **Encoding:** Converts categorical data to numerical form i.e one-hot encoding.
- **Mathematical transformations:** Like logarithmic transformations for skewed data.

## 3. Feature Extraction
Extracting meaningful features can reduce dimensionality and improve model accuracy
- **Dimensionality reduction:** Techniques like PCA reduce features while preserving important information.
- **Aggregation & Combination:** Summing or averaging features to simplify the model.

## 4. Feature Selection
Feature selection involves choosing a subset of relevant features to use:
- **Filter methods:** Based on statistical measures like correlation.
- **Wrapper methods:** Select based on model performance.
- **Embedded methods:** Feature selection integrated within model training.

## 5. Feature Scaling
Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the model:
- **Min-Max scaling:** Rescales values to a fixed range like 0 to 1.
- **Standard scaling:** Normalizes to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1.

# Steps in Feature Engineering
- **Data Cleaning:** Identify and correct errors or inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure data quality and reliability.
- **Data Transformation:** Transform raw data into a format suitable for modeling including scaling, normalization and encoding.
- **Feature Extraction:** Create new features by combining or deriving information from existing ones to provide more meaningful input to the model.
- **Feature Selection:** Choose the most relevant features for the model using techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information and stepwise regression.
- **Feature Iteration:** Continuously refine features based on model performance by adding, removing or modifying features for improvement.

# Common Techniques in Feature Engineering
## 1. One-Hot Encoding
One-Hot Encoding converts categorical variables into binary indicators, allowing them to be used by machine learning models.
```python
import pandas as pd
data = {'Color': ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Blue']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['Color'], prefix='Color')
print(df_encoded)
```
```text
Output
   Color_Blue  Color_Green  Color_Red
0       False        False       True
1        True        False      False
2       False         True      False
3        True        False      False
```

## 2. Binning
Binning transforms continuous variables into discrete bins, making them categorical for easier analysis.
```python
import pandas as pd
data = {'Age': [23, 45, 18, 34, 67, 50, 21]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
bins = [0, 20, 40, 60, 100]
labels = ['0-20', '21-40', '41-60', '61+']
df['Age_Group'] = pd.cut(df['Age'], bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)
print(df)
```
```text
Output
   Age Age_Group
0   23     21-40
1   45     41-60
2   18      0-20
3   34     21-40
4   67       61+
5   50     41-60
6   21     21-40
```

## 3. Text Data Preprocessing: 
Involves removing stop-words, stemming and vectorizing text data to prepare it for machine learning models.
```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
texts = ["This is a sample sentence.", "Text data preprocessing is important."]
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
stemmer = PorterStemmer()
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
def preprocess_text(text):
    words = text.split()
    words = [stemmer.stem(word)
             for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]
    return " ".join(words)
cleaned_texts = [preprocess_text(text) for text in texts]
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(cleaned_texts)
print("Cleaned Texts:", cleaned_texts)
print("Vectorized Text:", X.toarray())
```
```text

```
## 4. Feature Splitting
Divides a single feature into multiple sub-features, uncovering valuable insights and improving model performance.
```python
import pandas as pd
data = {'Full_Address': [
    '123 Elm St, Springfield, 12345', '456 Oak Rd, Shelbyville, 67890']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df[['Street', 'City', 'Zipcode']] = df['Full_Address'].str.extract(
    r'([0-9]+\s[\w\s]+),\s([\w\s]+),\s(\d+)')
print(df)
```
```text
Output
                     Full_Address      Street         City Zipcode
0  123 Elm St, Springfield, 12345  123 Elm St  Springfield   12345
1  456 Oak Rd, Shelbyville, 67890  456 Oak Rd  Shelbyville   67890...
```

# Tools for Feature Engineering
There are several tools available for feature engineering. Here are some popular ones:
